### Node naming convention

I currently do not require a formal naming convention, so I am simply using an
arbitrary naming scheme. I set up different nodes with different services (for
now), so even naming a node "puppet" does not show it may also run other server
applications (which in my use case, it may).

This may change in the future, but for now I will simply maintain a list of
hostnames and the services they provide.

Name - service mapping

maia = data
polaris = dns
vega = sec
kraz = proxy
sol = puppet, binhost, provision
sirius = web

Network naming conventions

internal.nitelite.io are nodes on the local subnet
external.nitelite.io are nodes on remote subnets

development server names - dev.name.tld (needed when working with others)
staging server names - stage.name.tld
production app names - name.tld

Use internal DNS, hosts, nginx w/e to manage the names. Just make sure to not
make your dev environments public

### Volumes

luna = main file share
io = backup
europa = mirrors
callisto = mail
rhea = kvm guest images
