# /etc/acpi/events/default
# This is the ACPID default configuration, it takes all
# events and passes them to /etc/acpi/default.sh for further
# processing.

# event keeps a regular expression matching the event. To get
# power events only, just use something like "event=button[ /]power.*"
# to catch it.
# action keeps the command to be executed after an event occurs
# In case of the power event above, your entry may look this way:
#event=button[ /]power.*
#action=/sbin/init 0

# Optionally you can specify the placeholder %e. It will pass
# through the whole kernel event message to the program you've
# specified.

event=.*
action=/etc/acpi/default.sh %e

# allows you to enable and disable Bluetooth via the key combination Fn+F5
event=ibm/hotkey HKEY 00000080 00001005
# TODO: Test the hotkey. if it's not working, set this to point to the
# toggle-bluetooth script
#action=/usr/bin/bluetooth
action=/usr/local/bin/toggle-bluetooth
