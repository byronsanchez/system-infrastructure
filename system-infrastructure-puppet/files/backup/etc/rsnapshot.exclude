# exclude project symlinks
#
# On all workstations, there is a dropbox folder or a projects folder as the
# authoritative source data folder
#
# to be more specific, mira has an authoritative reference folder with
# dropbox+projects symlinking to it. because this also hosts the backups,
# rsnapshot copies symlinks as symlinks instead of duping the data
#
# on dropbox "client" machines, dropbox is the authoritative data directory and
# symlinks are built to point to it. Let's write some exclude rules to be safe.
